# 📊 End-to-End SQL Portfolio Project for Data Analyst

Welcome to my **SQL Portfolio Project** – a comprehensive, real-world SQL project built to showcase essential skills in querying, data wrangling, and generating meaningful insights from raw datasets using SQL.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a **bookstore data analysis system**, showcasing SQL skills across data modeling, importing CSV files, and running business-focused analysis. The entire workflow was performed using SQL only — no third-party tools or scripting.

---

## 🧱 Database Design

### 🗂️ Tables Created

- **BOOKS**:  
  Stores book inventory with details like title, author, genre, publish year, price, and stock.

- **CUSTOMERS**:  
  Contains customer details like name, email, phone, and location info.

- **ORDERS**:  
  Tracks each book purchase with references to both customers and books.

---

## 📥 Data Import

Data was imported into each table using PostgreSQL’s `COPY` command from local CSV files:

- `Books.csv`
- `Customers.csv`
- `Orders.csv`

This simulates a real-world ETL process using only SQL.

4. 🛒 Show orders placed in **November 2023**  
5. 📦 Calculate **total stock** of books available  
6. 💸 Find the **most expensive book**  
7. 👥 Display customers who have placed orders  
8. 💰 Calculate total **revenue per month**  
9. 🏙️ Analyze order trends by **city/country**

These queries simulate real business intelligence questions that data analysts are expected to solve.
